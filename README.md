## [Hover Board](https://nataligru.github.io/hover-board/)

This is a React-based game.

## Rules

Hover your cursor over a square to change its color. When you hover over it again, it will return to its initial color.

## How to Use

At the start, a dropdown menu labeled `Pick mode` is displayed. It contains difficulty levels for the game.
After selecting a mode, the `Start` button becomes active. Click it to display the game board.
After the first hover, the `Clear board` button becomes available to reset the board to its initial state.
On the right side, a list of selected squares in the format `row # col #` appears after the first hover.
For convenience, you can delete any move from the list by clicking the `x` button in the upper right corner of the list item.

## Objective
The goal of the game is to fill all squares with color.
Upon successfully completing a level, a congratulatory message and a `Next` button appear for an easy transition to the next level in the list.
